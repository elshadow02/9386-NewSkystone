 * Class: A class is similar to the blueprint of an object. It has properties and methods that it

 * Example: Humans; has properties like Gender, height, and weight; has methods or functions like
 *    walking, running, grabbing something, and speaking.
 *
 * Public: A Java Keyword that allows other files/classes to use this class.
 *
 * LearnJava: The name of the class. Typically, class names start with a capital letter and if the
 *    class name has more than one word each word is capitalized.
 *
 * The code that's part of a class is contained inside a set of curly braces -- { }
 *
 * This file's name is "LearnJava.java" and its main class is called LearnJava. Each file must have
 *    a class named the same as the file but can contain other classes inside of the file.
